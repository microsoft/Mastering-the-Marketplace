This module lays the groundwork for those to come in this course on creating virtual machine offers in the Azure marketplace. It takes you through a high-level understanding of what is required to start setting up a Virtual Machine Offer in the Azure Marketplace, starting with basic understanding all the way up to generalizing the image for reference in your Partner Center configuration.

### Overview of a Virtual Machine Offer

<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196254" target="_blank">Video</a>

This module explores what constitutes a Virtual Machine and how they are deployed in the customer’s tenant. It also shows the billing models available for Virtual Machine offers in the Azure Marketplace as well as the step-by-step process involved in building these offers. You’ll see how to do these steps via demos in the next sections.

### Creating a Virtual Machine – Demo

<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196313" target="_blank">Video</a>

See step-by-step how to create a virtual machine in Azure. This virtual machine is used in subsequent modules to create an offer in the Azure Marketplace. We will look at considerations while creating the virtual machine, like availability zones, core sizes, base images etc.

### Generalizing a Windows Virtual Machine – Demo

<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196153" target="_blank">Video</a>

Generalizing a virtual machine is a necessary step to selling its image in the Azure Marketplace. Learn how to generalize a Windows virtual machine, preparing it for sale. You will learn steps to generalize a windows image and options to do the same with a Linux image.

### Capturing an Image into an Azure Compute Gallery – Demo

<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196312" target="_blank">Video</a>

See what an Azure Compute Gallery is and how it is used to structure virtual machine images within it. Understand how image definitions are used to save images and how they can be shared between users, as well as how to enable them to be shared in Partner Center for publication in the Azure Marketplace.

### Configuring a Virtual Machine Offer in Partner Center – Demo

<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196154" target="_blank">Video</a>

Learn how to set up technical configurations for Azure Marketplace virtual machine offers within Partner Center. You’ll look at machine generations, disk versions, share image gallery vs. SAS URI, and more.

### Certifications and Exceptions
