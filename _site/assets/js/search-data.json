The following steps will create an offer on your Partner Center Portal. | On the Homepage of Partner Center, look for Marketplace Offers and click that tile. If you have disabled Workspaces, then it will be visible as Commercial Marketplace. | Click the + New Offer button and select Azure Virtual Machine from the dropdown. | You will now have to enter a unique Offer ID and an Offer Alias. For the purpose of uniformity for this lab, we will set a unique string to identify resources, like so, . | Offer ID: vmworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING | Offer Alias: VM Workshop YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING | . Replace the variable YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING with a name unique to your organization . | . Once the offer is created, navigate to the Offer Setup page by clicking on that tab on the left . Offer Setup . Offer Setup page will direct you with ways to change your offer alias as well as enable Test Drive. For the purpose of this lab, we will leave everything as is and only configure the Customer leads section. Customer leads . Here, you will attach your offer to an Azure Data Storage table which will act as a connected Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) for your offer. Create the Azure Storage account . This is the first time you’re using the Azure portal for this class. It is recommended that you install all the resources you’ll create in this class into the same Resource Group, just to keep things tidy within your Azure subscription. | Open a new tab for the Azure portal and log in. | Create a Resource Group named vmworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING. Please note that this is the same unique string you added while creating the offer. | In the vmworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING Resource Group, create a standard Azure Storage account. This will be your CRM database, so name it **vmworkshopsayouruniquestring **. Note all characters are lower case for naming a storage account. | Once the storage account is created, browse to the storage account’s overview page. | In the left-hand menu, find the Security + networking section. | In that section, find and click on the Access keys link. | At the top of the page, click the Show keys link, and you see the connection strings for the database. | Copy a connection string to your copy/paste buffer. | .
