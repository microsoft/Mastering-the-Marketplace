## Azure AD Application Registrations

[Video](https://youtu.be/-wjlgxJIlWQ) | [PDF](./pdfs/05-Azure-AD-Application-Registrations.pdf)

In this module we look at a generic topic, application registrations for Azure Active Directory because we’ll need to use them in our upcoming modules. They give us a mechanism to authenticate to Azure AD, which is a requirement of the landing page, if you recall.

This video should help you get a jump start on configuring application registrations for the apps we’ll be building in the next few modules.

> **NOTE:** The secrets that you set in an Application Registration have time limits. You may select up to 2 years for the secret to remain valid. In production, track when your secrets need to be changed and do so to avoid service outages.

This module introduces just enough on this topic to help us build our landing page and webhooks later in the course. For those interested in more reading, please see [Create and Azure AD app registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/azure-ad-transactable-saas-landing-page#create-an-azure-ad-app-registration) and [Quick start: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) from the official Microsoft documentation.

## Using the SaaS Offer REST Fulfillment API

[Video](https://youtu.be/eizdN6XNyvw) | [PDF](./pdfs/06-Using-the-SaaS-Offer-Fulfillment-API.pdf)

See the SaaS Fulfillment REST API in action as we send it through its paces using Postman. You’ll learn how to authenticate with Azure Active Directory, resolve and activate subscriptions just like your Landing Page does, and see many other features of the API.

This module prepares you for working with the language-specific client libraries.

This modules requires you to have knowledge of [Application Registrations in AAD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

An Application Registration is used in the examples when making the first request to retrieve an authentication token from Azure Active Directory. You should be familiar with creating an Application Registration and finding the following information in the Azure Portal.

1. The [Tenant ID and App ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in)
1. A [Client Secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) on the Application Registration

## The SaaS Client Library for .NET

[Video](https://youtu.be/uihNXaDBXVQ) | [PDF](./pdfs/07-The-SaaS-Client-Library-for-.NET.pdf) | [Code](./demo-code/the-saas-client-library-for-dotnet)

This module introduces the [SaaS Client Library for .NET](https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-client-dotnet) developers who want to work with the SaaS APIs at a level of abstraction above the REST level.

The client library is a fully functional .NET package that you can [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Marketplace.SaaS.Client) and use in your applications.

This video shows a sample command line application that can talk to the client library API and the code is available in this repository via the link above.

## Building a Simple SaaS Landing Page in .NET

[Video](https://youtu.be/QoDXqp3GH_s) | [PDF](./pdfs/08-simple-landing-page-dotnet.pdf) | [Code](./demo-code/saas-simple-landing-page)

In this module we examine the elements of building a simple landing page and looking at how it works.We examine the following topics.

- The purpose of a landing page
- A humble landing page in action
- The code
- Available data to display

The technology stack used is C#, ASP.NET MVC, and Razor views, just to keep it simple. We use the [SaaS Client Library for .NET](#the-saas-client-library-for-net) to build out our landing page functionality.

## Building a Simple SaaS Publisher Portal in .NET

And more! Consider watching this video before moving on to the code-based modules for implementing and securing a SaaS offer webhook.

## Implementing a Simple SaaS Webhook in .NET

[Video](https://youtu.be/higEi441t1Q) | [Code](./demo-code/simple-webhook-dotnet-implementing)

This code-heavy module focuses on the fundamentals of implementing a SaaS offer webhook as an Azure function using .NET. Concepts are presented in such a way as to be architecture and technology stack agnostic.

## Securing a Simple SaaS Webhook in .NET

[Video](https://youtu.be/Wifuc5jAY7E) | [PDF](./pdfs/10.3-simple-webhook-dotnet-securing.pdf) | [Code](./demo-code/simple-webhook-dotnet-securing)

This security-focused module introduces several techniques for securing a SaaS offer webhook and then dives into code looking at implementations of the techniques presented. This module builds on the concepts and code presented in the module, “[Implementing a Simple SaaS Webhook in .NET](#implementing-a-simple-saas-webhook-in-net)”.

Although utilizing an Azure function built in .NET, topics are presented in such a way as to be architecture and technology stack agnostic.
