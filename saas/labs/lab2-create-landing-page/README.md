# Lab 2: Creating a Landing Page

In this lab, you will build on what you accomplished in [Lab 1: Creating a SaaS Offer in Partner Center](../lab1-create-pc-offer/README.md). You will deploy a landing page and integrate it with your Partner Center SaaS Offer, enabling publishing of the offer and purchasing the offer in the **Preview** stage of the publication pipeline.

For this lab you will need the following.

1. An offer configured in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard) as per Lab 1
1. An Azure account and access to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
1. Visual Studio 2022 (any version)
1. Git (optional)

> **Note:** It is possible to complete this using Visual Studio Code, but the instructions will be tailored for using Visual Studio 2022.

## Exercise: Compile the Visual Studio Solution

There are three projects in the solution you'll be working with. You will deal with them one at a time over the course of the labs. In this lab, we will start with the landing page project.

1. Clone this repository or download a ZIP file of its contents and UNZIP them on your machine.

    https://github.com/microsoft/Mastering-the-Marketplace

2. Using Visual Studio 2022, open the following solution file on your machine. Take care to choose the **begin** folder.

    `**\Mastering-the-Marketplace\saas\labs\lab-code\begin\SaaSLabsBegin.sln`

3. Build the solution. You should get no build errors.

## Exercise: Creating a Single-Tenant Application Registrations

In this exercise, you will create an app registration in the Azure portal. It will be single-tenant and used to connect to the SaaS API. 

### Create a single-tenant App Registration

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
1. In the top-of-center command window in the portal, type "app reg" and select the item "App registrations" that appears. You will see a list of current application registrations.
1. At the top of the page click the **+ New registration** link. You are taken to the **Register an application page**.
1. For the purposes of this lab, use `saas-workshop-single-tenant` as the name of this app registration.
1. At the bottom of the page, click the **Register** button.

### Add a secret

Now you will add a secret to the app registration. Make sure to copy and paste the secret value somewhere you can access it later.

1. Click into the `saas-workshop-single-tenant` application registration.
1. In the left-hand menu, find the **Manage** menu and click the **Certificates and secrets** link.
1. Create a new client secret.
    1. Give it a description.
    1. Choose an expiration date. The 6-month default should be fine.
1. Copy the **Value** of the secret and paste it somewhere you can easily access it later.

## Exercise: Creating a multi-tenant App Registration

In this exercise you wil create a multi-tenant app registration in the Azure portal. It be used to authenticate users coming to your landing page.

1. Create an app registration. For the purposes of this lab, use `saas-workshop-multi-tenant` as the name of this app registration.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select the option: **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)**.
1. At the bottom of the page, click the **Register** button.

### Add a platform to the multi-tenant app registration

1. In the left-hand menu under the **Overview** menu item, click the **Quickstart** link.

1. In the left-hand menu under the **Manage** section, click the **Authentication** link.

    > Here you can see that two URLS have been added to the Redirect URIs section for you. These allow running your code in debug mode using the default debugger ports. You will add your actual landing page URLs here later.

### Create a client secret

1. Create a client secret for this app registration.
1. Copy the **Value** of the secret and paste it somewhere you can easily access it later.

## Exercise: appsettings.json

The `appsettings.json` file in the LandingPage project must be filled out before publishing the application. That's what you'll do in this section.

### Values from the saas-workshop-multi-tenant app registration

All changes in this section occur under the `AzureAD` section of the `appsettings.json` file.

1. In the Landing Page project, open the `appsettings.json` file.
1. In the Azure portal, click the **Azure Active Directory** button in the left-hand menu.

1. For Publish type, select **Publish (generate pubxmlfile)**.
1. Click the **Finish** button at the bottom of the dialog.

You now have a publish profile that can be used to publish your application.

### Publishing the landing page

Near the top-right of the Publish dialog click the **Publish** button. This deploys your application. You can watch the publish process in the Output window at the bottom of the screen.

> The page will launch, but shows an error message. You aren't quite done configuring your landing page application.

### Registering your landing page

1. In the command bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for and select **App Services**.
1. Click on the App Service you just created, **SaaSWorkshopLandingPage**..
1. On the overview screen in Visual Studio, the **URL** for the site should be in the **Hosting** section. Copy it into your paste buffer.
1. In the command bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for and select **App registrations**.
1. Click on the `saas-workshop-multi-tenant` app registration.
1. In the left-hand menu click the **Authentication** link.
1. In the **Web > Redirect URIs** section, click **Add URI** and paste in your Landing Page URL.

    > https://*.azurewebsites.net/signin-oidc

Click the **Save** button at the top of the screen.

## Exercise: Browse to your landing page

1. Using the App Service URL to you created, `https://<prefix>.azurewebsites.net`, browse to that web page.
1. Authenticate when prompted.
1. You should see a message that reads, "**Token URL parameter cannot be empty**."

> **This is good!** You are seeing this message because you aren't coming to the landing page through the Azure portal and no marketplace purchase token is being passed. To finish your configuration, we need to configure Partner Center to be aware of the landing page.

## Exercise: Update Your Offer in Partner Center and Publish It

Now that you have deployed your application, you can configure the **Technical configuration** section of Partner Center.

1. Open your offer in Partner Center.
1. Navigate to the **Technical configuration** tab.

### Technical configuration

1. For **Landing page URL**, enter the URL of your new landing page.
1. For **Connection webhook**, enter the URL of your new landing page.

    > This is not the correct value for the webhook, but we haven't published a webhook yet and this will act as a placeholder for now.

1. Enter the **Azure Active Directory tenant ID** you've deployed your landing page to.
1. For **Azure Active Directory application ID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** of the `saas-workshop-single-tenant` App registration.
1. Click the **Save draft** button.
1. Click the **Review and publish** button. The Status of all sections in your offer should be green.
1. Click the **Publish** button at the bottom of the screen.

You will be directed to the top of the Offer overview, where you may watch the publication process as it occurs. You must refresh the page to see status updates. You only want to publish as far as the **Publisher signoff** section. When the test links appear under that section, **DO NOT** press the **Go Live** button.

![Offer overview](../lab-images/02.png)

You will need to hit refresh for awhile as your offer goes through the publish stages.

This is the end of the lab for now as it will take some time for the offer to complete publishing to the **Publisher signoff** stage.

> To check your offers' publication status, go to the offer's **Overview** page. Look for links under the **Publisher signoff** section as shown below.

![Offer Overview](../lab-images/01.png)

Refresh the **Overview** page to get updates on your offer during the publication process.

> Publishing your offer will take some time. Hopefully your offer will be published to the preview stage by the end of the next lecture. Wait to purchase your offer until it is in preview as shown above.

## Exercise: Buy Your Offer and Check Your Landing Page

In Partner Center, after the offer is in preview stage, you may purchase it. After the initial purchase, you will then be routed to the landing page for the offer.

## Subscribing to your offer

Once the **Publisher signoff** section has links under it, still **DO NOT** press the **Go live** button. Instead, this state is where you will test the purchase and functionality of your SaaS application.

Under the **Publisher signoff** section of the Offer overview page, click the **Azure portal preview** link.

> If you receive the message, "Could not create the marketplace item" or a "404" message, wait another several minutes and try again. The offer is simply still being created. Offer creation can take up to 45 minutes in some cases.

### Moving to the next lab

If you still can't make your purchase, move on to Lab 3 where you will deploy a publisher portal. This publisher portal is a site wherein publishers can activate a customer's subscription.

Once you have completed lab 3, you may come back and complete this purchase.

### Purchasing the SaaS offer

Once you can click the **Azure portal preview** link in Partner Center, you will see a form to fill out to purchase your SaaS Offer. Move on to the next section.

**You are now acting in the role of the customer.**

1. Click **Get it Now**. On the next screen  you can fill it out and subscribe to the subscription you are making.
1. For Resource group, create a new one named `saas-workshop-purchases`.
1. Give your SaaS offer a name. Consider `SaaSWorkshop01`.
1. Click the **Review + subscribe** button at the bottom of the page.
1. Click the **Subscribe** button at the bottom of the page.

    > Your subscription is being provisioned. Once it is complete, you will see a **Configure account now** button on the screen.

1. Click the **Configure account now** button. You are taken to the landing page where you see details about the subscription you are buying.

## Congratulations

You are done with this lab.
