## Create the ACR

This exercise walks through creating an Azure Container Registry (ACR) for use in the Container Offers lab.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Container Registry**.

3. In the **Basics** tab, enter values for **Resource group** and **Registry name**. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. 
4. For this lab create a new resource group in the `West US` location named `myResourceGroup`.
5. For **SKU**, select 'Basic'.

6. Accept default values for the remaining settings. Select the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the screen. 
7. After reviewing the settings, select **Create**. The deployment of the ACR begins.
8. When the `Deployment succeeded` message appears, click the **Go to resource** button. You will see the ACR as in the image below.

9. Take note of the registry name and the value of the **Login server**, which is a fully qualified name ending with `azurecr.io`. You will use these values later.

## Give the Marketplace access to your ACR

The Azure Marketplace will host your CNAB in a Marketplace special ACR of its own. You must grant access to the Microsoft ACR by creating a special service principal in your tenant. 

> üóíÔ∏è To perform these steps you must have the [Azure CLI installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

1. Run the following commands to add the service principal.

        az login
        az ad sp create --id 32597670-3e15-4def-8851-614ff48c1efa

    Note this ID for use in the following steps.

2. Get the ID of your ACR.

        az acr show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name <ACR Server> --query "id" --output tsv

    Note the full ID for the use in the following steps.

3. Create a role assignment to grant the service principal the ability to pull from your registry using the values you obtained earlier.

    > üóíÔ∏è To assign Azure roles, you must have the following.
    >
    > `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as **User Access Administrator** or **Owner**.

    Run the following command.

        az role assignment create --assignee <service-principal-id> --scope <registry-id> --role acrpull

4. The `Microsoft.PartnerCenterIngestion` resource provider must be registered on the same subscription used to create your Azure Container Registry. Use the following command to do the registration.

        az provider register --namespace Microsoft.PartnerCenterIngestion --subscription <subscription-id> --wait

    Use the following command to monitor the progress of the provider registration to ensure it completes successfully.

        az provider show -n Microsoft.PartnerCenterIngestion --subscription <subscription-id>



**Congratulations!** You now have an Azure Container Registry to use in the labs and perhaps eventually for your production offers.

Go back to the [lab prerequisites](index.md) and follow on with remaining steps.
