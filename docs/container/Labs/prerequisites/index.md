# Lab Prerequisites

There are several must-have and some nice-to-have prerequisites for completing the labs in the Mastering Container offers course.

## Accounts

To complete these labs you will need the following accounts.

- An Azure account to be used to create resources through the Azure portal
- A Partner Center account wherein you can create offers

## Software

The following software is also needed to complete set labs. The below steps walk you through setting up these software prerequisites.

1. [An Azure Container Registry](acr.md)
2. [An Azure Kubernetes Service instance](aks.md)
3. [Docker Desktop](docker.md)
4. For Windows users, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) must be installed. See [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install it.
5. You'll spend a lot of time on the command line in these labs. For Windows users we **recommend** [installing Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) as it gives a great terminal experience on Windows.
6. A text editor of your choice. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for any platform.

Once you have completed these prerequisites, go back to the [Container Offer labs home page](../../index.md) and proceed to the first lab.

## Experience

Although not necessary to make it through the labs, you will get more value with experience in the following topics. Again, knowledge of these topics is not required, but recommended. 

1. Docker
2. Helm
3. ARM templates
4. Azure Container Registry
5. Kubernetes
6. Linux command line
