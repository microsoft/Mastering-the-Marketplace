## Scanning container images for vulnerabilities

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/scanning-container-images-for-vulnerabilities-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

In this comprehensive demo you‚Äôll learn how to identify vulnerabilities in your images that can prevent your Container offer from passing certification. Not only will you see Microsoft Defender for Cloud in action, but you‚Äôll see how to patch a container and prepare its‚Äô image for publication to an ACR so that it no longer contains vulnerabilities.

## Preparing CNAB bundle artifacts

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/preparing-cnab-bundle-artifacts-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

In this hands-on module, learn about the artifacts needed to create your final CNAB bundle. This video explores what they are and looks at some details in each. You‚Äôll see the following.

- Solution files
- Helm chart
- K8s deployment files
- Marketplace deployment files
- The CNAB manifest

## Generating the CNAB bundle

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/generating-the-cnab-bundle-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

This module demonstrates the process of creating a CNAB bundle for publication to the Microsoft commercial marketplace. This video is primarily on the command line and shows using the publicly available CNAB bundling tool available from the Microsoft public Azure Container Registry.

## Create a container offer in Partner Center

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/creating-a-container-offer-in-partner-center-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

In this all-demo module, you‚Äôll see what is needed to create a Container Offer in Partner Center.

This module focuses on creating a plan within an already existing offer. 

This hands-on demo walks through setting up a new plan in Partner Center including the technical configuration of the plan, in which we map the CNAB bundle to the new plan.

## Subscribe to a Kubernetes app in the Commercial Marketplace

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/subscribing-to-a-kubernetes-app-in-the-commercial-marketplace-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

In this brief demo, you see how customers purchase a Kubernetes app and deploy it into their K8s cluster. You‚Äôll see the process from marketplace to deployed and running application.

## Unsubscribe from a purchased Kubernetes app

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/unsubscribing-from-a-kubernetes-app-that-you-purchased-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

In this walkthrough video, you‚Äôll see how to get rid of an application you may have purchased, and stop being billed for that app. We use the command line with the az CLI and KubeCtl to perform these operations.

## Securing virtual machines and containers for certification

<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/securing-vms-and-containers-for-certification-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a> | [PDF](./pdfs/0.0-securing-vm-and-container-images-overview.pdf)

The last thing you want is to create and publish an offer only to have it fail Microsoft‚Äôs certification process. This module provides important tips and effective practices for securing virtual machines and containers before publication to the Azure Marketplace, so your offer makes it through certification the first time.
