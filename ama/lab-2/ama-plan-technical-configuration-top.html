      Several settings are seen at the top of the technical configuration page.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The version number is a 3-part (1.0.0 for example) versioning number you may increment when updating the plan. 
        Typically start at 1.0.0 and increment the number 
        if you later change the technical configuration in some way, like changing the ZIP file in the next step.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ZIP file containing your Managed application artifacts. createUiDefinition.json and mainTemplate.json go in the ZIP file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enabling JIT access allows cusomers to control when you are able to access the resources
        to perform updates. This allows more control for the customer on update events.
      </li>
      <li>
        The notification endpoint URL specifies a webhook that will get called as the application is provisioned.
        You may have a need to respond to lifecycle events such as "Success" that occur when the anaged application 
        is created. If you have no need to respond to these events, this field is left blank. An Azure function can work well here when needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Customizing customer actions allows setting specific permissions that the customer will
        have on the resources created in the managed resource group.
      </li>
    </ol>
